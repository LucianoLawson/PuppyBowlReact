# PuppyBowlReact

My job will be to handle the data about each of our puppy competitors and their owners. To that purpose, I will be interacting with the "Puppy Bowl" API we have built that hosts the data I will need about each puppy, each of its owners, and even the teams they are on.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
